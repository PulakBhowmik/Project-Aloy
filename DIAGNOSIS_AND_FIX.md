# üîç DIAGNOSIS: Available Tag Not Changing After Booking

## üî¥ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### The Problem Was:
**The application was running with OLD CODE!**

### What Happened:
1. ‚úÖ Code was fixed at 10:13 PM (PaymentResultController.java)
2. ‚úÖ Code was compiled successfully
3. ‚ùå **Application was NEVER restarted** with the new code!
4. ‚ùå Old application kept running on port 8080
5. ‚ùå Bookings used OLD logic (no apartment marking)

### Evidence:
```bash
# Payment showed COMPLETED status (fix was partially working)
payment_id=17, status='COMPLETED', apartment_id=11

# But apartment was NEVER marked as booked (old code running)
apartment_id=11, booked=0x00, status='AVAILABLE'  ‚ùå
```

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION APPLIED

### Actions Taken (October 5, 2025 @ 10:56 PM):

1. **Killed old application process (PID 5560)**
   ```bash
   taskkill //PID 5560 //F
   ```

2. **Rebuilt application with latest code**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean compile
   ```

3. **Started fresh application**
   ```bash
   nohup ./mvnw spring-boot:run > /tmp/springboot-new.log 2>&1 &
   ```

4. **Verified application started successfully**
   - Tomcat started on port 8080 ‚úÖ
   - No errors in logs ‚úÖ
   - API responding correctly ‚úÖ

## üß™ TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### IMPORTANT: Fresh Test Required!

The previous booking (payment_id=17, apartment_id=11) happened with OLD code. You need to do a **NEW booking** to test the fix.

### Step 1: Prepare Test Apartment

```bash
# Reset apartment 14 for testing
mysql -u rental_user2 -p123456 -D apartment_rental_db -e "UPDATE apartments SET booked=0, status='AVAILABLE' WHERE apartment_id=14;"
```

### Step 2: Verify It's Available

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/apartments/14 | python -m json.tool | grep -E "(booked|status)"
```

**Expected:**
```json
"booked": false,
"status": "AVAILABLE"
```

### Step 3: Book Apartment #14

1. **Open browser:** `http://localhost:8080/`
2. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl + Shift + R (clear cache!)
3. **Find "Toiyob Building"** (apartment #14)
4. **Verify it shows GREEN "AVAILABLE" badge**
5. **Click "View Details"**
6. **Click "Book for Myself"**
7. **Complete SSLCommerz test payment**
8. **Watch for:**
   - PDF download ‚úÖ
   - "Receipt Downloaded Successfully!" message ‚úÖ
   - Automatic redirect to homepage ‚úÖ

### Step 4: Verify Frontend Update

**IMMEDIATELY after redirect:**
- Apartment #14 should show **RED "BOOKED" badge** ‚úÖ
- If still showing green, do **ONE MORE hard refresh** (Ctrl + Shift + R)

### Step 5: Verify Database

```bash
mysql -u rental_user2 -p123456 -D apartment_rental_db -e "SELECT apartment_id, address, booked, status FROM apartments WHERE apartment_id=14;"
```

**Expected:**
```
apartment_id: 14
address: Toiyob Building
booked: 0x01  ‚úÖ (must be 0x01, not 0x00)
status: RENTED ‚úÖ
```

### Step 6: Verify Payment

```bash
mysql -u rental_user2 -p123456 -D apartment_rental_db -e "SELECT payment_id, transaction_id, apartment_id, status FROM payment WHERE apartment_id=14 ORDER BY payment_id DESC LIMIT 1;"
```

**Expected:**
```
status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
apartment_id: 14 ‚úÖ
```

### Step 7: Check Application Logs

```bash
tail -100 /tmp/springboot-new.log | grep -E "(Payment success GET|Attempting to complete|marked as BOOKED)"
```

**Expected to see:**
```
[DEBUG] Payment success GET endpoint called with tranId: PAY##
[DEBUG] Attempting to complete payment for tranId: PAY##
[DEBUG] Payment record found: ID=##, apartmentId=14, status=PENDING
[DEBUG] Payment status updated to COMPLETED
[DEBUG] Marking apartment 14 as booked
[SUCCESS] Apartment 14 successfully marked as BOOKED and RENTED
```

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue 1: Application Not Responding

**Check if running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/apartments/1
```

**If not working:**
```bash
# Check process
ps aux | grep java | grep spring-boot

# Check logs
tail -50 /tmp/springboot-new.log
```

### Issue 2: Still Shows OLD Behavior

**Possible Causes:**
1. Application not restarted after fix
2. Browser caching aggressively
3. Multiple Spring Boot instances running

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Kill ALL Java processes
taskkill //F //IM java.exe

# 2. Rebuild and restart
cd "/d/My Downloads/project aloy/project-aloy"
./mvnw clean compile
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# 3. Clear browser cache completely
# Or use Incognito/Private mode
```

### Issue 3: Database Not Updating

**Check if transaction committed:**
```bash
# View all recent payments
mysql -u rental_user2 -p123456 -D apartment_rental_db -e "SELECT * FROM payment ORDER BY payment_id DESC LIMIT 3;"

# Check if apartment was locked
tail -50 /tmp/springboot-new.log | grep "findByIdForUpdate"
```

## üìã PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

Before testing, ensure:

- [ ] Old application killed (check with `netstat -ano | findstr :8080`)
- [ ] Application rebuilt (`./mvnw clean compile` completed)
- [ ] New application started (check `/tmp/springboot-new.log`)
- [ ] API responding (`curl http://localhost:8080/api/apartments/1`)
- [ ] Test apartment reset (`apartment_id=14, booked=0, status='AVAILABLE'`)
- [ ] Browser cache cleared (Ctrl + Shift + R)

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

After booking apartment #14 with NEW application:

‚úÖ Payment.status = 'COMPLETED'  
‚úÖ Apartment.booked = 0x01 (true)  
‚úÖ Apartment.status = 'RENTED'  
‚úÖ Frontend shows RED "BOOKED" badge  
‚úÖ Booking buttons hidden on apartment #14  
‚úÖ Logs show "[SUCCESS] Apartment 14 successfully marked as BOOKED and RENTED"

## üìä HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### Previous Booking (OLD CODE):
```
Time: ~10:51 PM
Payment ID: 17
Apartment ID: 11
Result: ‚ùå Payment updated, apartment NOT updated (old code)
```

### Next Booking (NEW CODE):
```
Time: After 10:56 PM
Apartment ID: 14 (recommended)
Expected: ‚úÖ Both payment AND apartment updated
```

## üöÄ SUMMARY

**What was wrong:** Application running with old code  
**What was fixed:** Killed old process, restarted with new code  
**What to do now:** Test fresh booking with apartment #14  
**Expected result:** Everything syncs correctly (payment, database, frontend)

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and Restarted  
**Application:** Running with new code (PID from process 11460)  
**Ready for:** Fresh booking test  
**Test Apartment:** #14 (Toiyob Building)
