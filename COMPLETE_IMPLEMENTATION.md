# 🎉 COMPLETE: One Tenant One Apartment Constraint

## ✅ What You Asked For

**Your Request:** "Make the system so one tenant can book only one apartment, and sync database and frontend accordingly."

**Status:** ✨ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** ✨

---

## 📦 What Was Done

### 1. **Consolidated All SQL Work** ✅
- ✅ Merged everything into **`project aloy sql.sql`**
- ✅ Deleted separate `one_tenant_one_apartment_constraint.sql` file
- ✅ One file to rule them all!

### 2. **Database Constraints** ✅
Added to `project aloy sql.sql`:
- ✅ Database triggers to block multiple bookings
- ✅ Performance indexes
- ✅ Duplicate cleanup
- ✅ Verification queries

### 3. **Backend Protection** ✅
- ✅ `PaymentService.java` - Added `tenantHasActiveBooking()` method
- ✅ `SSLCommerzPaymentController.java` - Enhanced validation at payment initiation
- ✅ Returns HTTP 409 (Conflict) with clear error messages

### 4. **Frontend Enforcement** ✅
Updated `app.js`:
- ✅ Checks booking status on page load
- ✅ Shows info banner if tenant has active booking
- ✅ Disables booking buttons for tenants with bookings
- ✅ Shows warnings in apartment details modal
- ✅ Blocks payment modal from opening
- ✅ Enhanced error handling

### 5. **Documentation** ✅
- ✅ `ONE_TENANT_ONE_APARTMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Full technical docs
- ✅ `ONE_TENANT_ONE_APARTMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Quick summary
- ✅ `TESTING_ONE_TENANT_ONE_APARTMENT.md` - Testing guide
- ✅ `ONE_TENANT_ONE_APARTMENT_CONSOLIDATED.md` - Quick reference
- ✅ `COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

## 🚀 How to Use It

### Step 1: Apply Database
```bash
# Run the main SQL file (includes constraint)
mysql -u rental_user2 -p < "project aloy sql.sql"
# Password: 123456
```

### Step 2: Build & Run Application
```bash
cd "/d/My Downloads/project aloy/project-aloy"

# Build (already done - SUCCESS ✅)
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# Run
java -jar target/apartment-rental-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Step 3: Test It
1. Login as tenant
2. Book an apartment (should work ✅)
3. Try to book another apartment (should be blocked ❌)
4. See info banner on homepage ✅
5. Buttons disabled in apartment details ✅

## 🛡️ Four Layers of Protection

### Layer 1: Frontend (Soft Block)
```javascript
// In app.js
if (userHasBooking) {
    alert('You already have an active booking!');
    return; // Block payment modal
}
```

### Layer 2: Backend API (Hard Block)
```java
// In SSLCommerzPaymentController
if (paymentService.tenantHasActiveBooking(tenantId)) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(409)
        .body("You already have an active apartment booking");
}
```

### Layer 3: Service Layer (Transaction Block)
```java
// In PaymentService
if (existingBooking) {
    throw new RuntimeException(
        "Tenant already has an active apartment booking"
    );
}
```

### Layer 4: Database (Ultimate Block)
```sql
-- In database triggers
IF booking_count > 0 THEN
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
    SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Tenant already has an active apartment booking';
END IF;
```

**Result:** Even if someone bypasses the frontend, backend, and service layer, the database will still block it! 🔒

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before Implementation ❌
- Tenant could book multiple apartments
- No warnings or restrictions

  - Clear info banner on homepage
  - Booking buttons disabled
  - Warning message in modal
  - Helpful error if they try anyway
  - Clear guidance: "Contact support to change booking"

## 🔍 Verification Queries

### Check Triggers Exist
```sql
SHOW TRIGGERS FROM apartment_rental_db WHERE `Table` = 'payment';
```

### Check for Violations (Should Return 0)
```sql
SELECT tenant_id, COUNT(*) as bookings
FROM payment
WHERE status = 'COMPLETED' AND apartment_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY tenant_id
HAVING bookings > 1;
```

### View All Tenant Bookings
```sql
SELECT 
    u.name,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN p.status = 'COMPLETED' THEN 1 END) as active_bookings,
    GROUP_CONCAT(a.title SEPARATOR ', ') as apartments
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN payment p ON u.user_id = p.tenant_id AND p.apartment_id IS NOT NULL
LEFT JOIN apartments a ON p.apartment_id = a.apartment_id
WHERE u.role = 'tenant' AND p.status = 'COMPLETED'
GROUP BY u.name;
```
