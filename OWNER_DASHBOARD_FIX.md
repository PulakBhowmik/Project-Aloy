# Owner Dashboard Fix - JavaScript File Corruption Issue

## Problem Report
**Issue**: Owner cannot see their apartments when clicking the "My Apartments" button.
**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Wrong:
The `owner-dashboard.js` file had **JavaScript syntax corruption** at line 7. The `document.addEventListener` statement was broken and mixed with unrelated HTML code from elsewhere in the file.

### Corrupted Code (Line 7):
```javascript
document.addEven                html += `<td><strong>${district.district}</strong></td>`;
                html += `<td><span class="badge bg-primary">${district.count}</span></td>`;
                html += `<td><strong class="text-success">৳${district.revenue.toFixed(2)}</strong></td>`;
                html += `<td>`;tener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
```

### What Happened:
1. The word `addEventListener` was split: `addEven...tener`
2. HTML code from line 135-138 (the revenue table section) was inserted in the middle
3. This caused a **JavaScript syntax error**
4. The `DOMContentLoaded` event listener never executed
5. The `loadOwnerApartments()` function was never called
6. Therefore, no apartments were fetched or displayed

---

## The Fix

### Corrected Code:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Check if user is logged in and is an owner
    currentUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));
    
    if (!currentUser || !currentUser.userId) {
        alert('Please login first');
        window.location.href = '/login';
        return;
    }
    
    if (currentUser.role !== 'OWNER') {
        alert('This page is only accessible to owners');
        window.location.href = '/';
        return;
    }
    
    renderNavbarUserInfo();
    loadOwnerApartments();  // This function fetches apartments from backend
});
```

### What Was Changed:
1. ✅ Restored proper `document.addEventListener` syntax
2. ✅ Removed corrupted HTML code insertion
3. ✅ Ensured `loadOwnerApartments()` is called on page load

---

## How the Flow Works (Now Fixed)

### 1. User Clicks "My Apartments" Button
- Location: `index.html` navigation bar
- Link: `<a href="/owner-dashboard">`
- Action: Navigates to `/owner-dashboard` URL

### 2. Backend Controller Handles Request
- File: `PageController.java`
- Mapping: `@GetMapping("/owner-dashboard")`
- Action: Returns `owner-dashboard.html` template

### 3. HTML Page Loads
- File: `owner-dashboard.html`
- Includes: Bootstrap CSS, custom CSS, Bootstrap JS, `owner-dashboard.js`
- Structure: Empty containers waiting for JavaScript to populate data

### 4. JavaScript Initializes (DOMContentLoaded)
- File: `owner-dashboard.js` (NOW FIXED)
- Action: 
  - Checks if user is logged in
  - Verifies user role is "OWNER"
  - Calls `renderNavbarUserInfo()`
  - Calls `loadOwnerApartments()` ← **THIS WAS BROKEN**

### 5. Load Owner Apartments Function
```javascript
function loadOwnerApartments() {
    fetch(`/api/apartments/owner/${currentUser.userId}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(apartments => {
            ownerApartments = apartments;
            renderApartments(apartments);    // Display apartments
            loadAnalytics();                  // Load stats
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error loading apartments:', error);
            document.getElementById('ownerApartmentsContainer').innerHTML = 
                '<div class="col-12"><div class="alert alert-danger">Failed to load apartments</div></div>';
        });
}
```

### 6. Backend API Endpoint
- File: `ApartmentController.java`
- Mapping: `GET /api/apartments/owner/{ownerId}`
- Method: `getApartmentsByOwnerId(@PathVariable Long ownerId)`
- Action: Calls `apartmentRepository.findByOwnerId(ownerId)`

### 7. Database Query
- File: `ApartmentRepository.java`
- Method: `List<Apartment> findByOwnerId(Long ownerId)`
- Query: `SELECT * FROM apartments WHERE owner_id = ?`
- Returns: List of apartments owned by the owner

### 8. Display Apartments
```javascript
function renderApartments(apartments) {
    // Creates apartment cards with:
    // - Title, district, address
    // - Monthly rent, availability
    // - Status badges (Available/Booked)
    // - Edit button (blue)
    // - Delete button (red)
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Access Owner Dashboard
1. Open browser: `http://localhost:8080`
2. Login as an **OWNER** user
3. Click **"My Apartments"** button in navbar
4. **Expected Result**: Dashboard loads successfully

### Test 2: Verify Apartments Display
1. On owner dashboard, look at the "My Apartments" tab
2. **Expected Result**: 
   - All your owned apartments appear in a grid
   - Each apartment shows title, address, rent, status
   - Edit and Delete buttons are visible

3. Refresh the page
4. **Expected Result**: No JavaScript errors

### Test 4: Check Network Requests
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for request: `GET /api/apartments/owner/{userId}`
5. **Expected Result**: 
   - Status: 200 OK
   - Response: JSON array of apartments

## Why This Happened

### Likely Causes:
1. **Merge conflict** - Code from different sections got mixed during a merge
2. **Copy-paste error** - Accidentally pasted HTML code into JavaScript
3. **Editor glitch** - Text editor may have corrupted the file during save
4. **Manual editing error** - Accidental deletion/insertion while editing

### Prevention:
- ✅ Use version control (Git) with regular commits
- ✅ Test after every change
- ✅ Use a linter (ESLint) to catch syntax errors
- ✅ Enable auto-formatting in editor
- ✅ Review code before committing
