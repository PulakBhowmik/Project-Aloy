## Next Steps for You

### Immediate Actions:
1. âœ… **Test the feature** using `OWNER_APARTMENT_QUICK_TEST.md`
2. âœ… **Review the UI** to ensure it meets your requirements
3. âœ… **Try editing** a few apartments

5. âœ… **Check all tabs** (Tenants, Revenue, History, Top)

### Optional (If Time Permits):
- Read `OWNER_APARTMENT_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed info
- Test edge cases (edit validation, delete confirmation)
- Review security features (try editing another owner's apartment)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No image upload** in edit modal (only text fields)
2. **Hard delete** (permanent, no undo)
3. **Can delete booked apartments** (may need prevention logic)
4. **No bulk actions** (delete multiple at once)
5. **No search/filter** on dashboard

### Future Improvements Suggested:
- Add image upload functionality
- Implement soft delete (archive)
- Prevent deletion of booked apartments
- Add bulk edit/delete
- Add search and filters
- Add edit history log

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### If Something Doesn't Work:

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Check network tab** to see API responses
3. **Verify you're logged in as an OWNER**
4. **Try hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5)
5. **Check server is running** on port 8080

### Common Issues:

**Modal doesn't open**
- Solution: Check Bootstrap JS is loaded

**Changes don't save**
- Solution: Verify ownership, check network response

**Delete doesn't work**
- Solution: Check for foreign key constraints
