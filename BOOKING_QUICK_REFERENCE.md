# Apartment Booking System - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**PROBLEM:** Multiple users could book the same apartment  
**SOLUTION:** Implemented comprehensive booking control system

---

## ✅ Key Changes Summary

### Database
- ✅ All apartments now have `status = 'AVAILABLE'` by default
- ✅ Booked apartments are marked with `booked = 1` AND `status = 'RENTED'`

### Backend
- ✅ **ApartmentRepository**: New `findAvailableApartments()` query
- ✅ **Payment Success Handler**: Saves apartment after marking as booked (CRITICAL FIX!)
- ✅ **Payment Initiation**: Validates availability before accepting bookings
- ✅ **Pessimistic Locking**: Prevents race conditions

### Frontend
- ✅ **Apartment Details Page**: Shows "ALREADY BOOKED" badge for booked apartments
- ✅ **Booking Buttons**: Hidden for unavailable apartments
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly messages from backend

## 🔍 How to Test

### Test 1: Book an Apartment
1. Go to http://localhost:8080
2. Click any available apartment
3. Click "Book for Myself"
4. Complete payment
5. **Expected:** Apartment shows "ALREADY BOOKED" and disappears from home page

### Test 2: Try to Book Again
1. Refresh the apartment details page
2. **Expected:** See warning message and no booking buttons
3. Go back to home page
4. **Expected:** Apartment no longer in search results

### Test 3: Check Database
```sql
mysql -u rental_user2 -p123456 -e "
  USE apartment_rental_db;
  SELECT apartment_id, title, booked, status 
  FROM apartments 
  WHERE booked = 1;
"
```
**Expected:** Shows booked apartments with `booked=0x01` and `status='RENTED'`

## 📊 API Behavior

### GET /api/apartments
- **Before:** Returned ALL apartments
- **After:** Returns ONLY available apartments (booked=false AND status='AVAILABLE')

### GET /api/apartments/{id}
- **Before:** Always returned apartment data
- **After:** Still returns data, but frontend shows booking status

### POST /api/payments/initiate
- **Before:** Accepted any apartment booking
- **After:** Returns HTTP 409 if apartment is already booked
  ```json
  {
    "error": "This apartment is already booked. Please choose another one."
  }
  ```

## 🐛 Debug Tips

### Check Apartment Status
```sql
SELECT apartment_id, title, booked, status 
FROM apartments 
WHERE apartment_id = [YOUR_APARTMENT_ID];
```

### Check Payment Records
```sql
SELECT payment_id, apartment_id, transaction_id, status 
FROM payment 
WHERE apartment_id = [YOUR_APARTMENT_ID]
ORDER BY payment_id DESC;
```

### View Application Logs
Look for these debug messages:
```
[DEBUG] Parsed apartmentId: 6
[DEBUG] Marking apartment 6 as booked and RENTED
[DEBUG] Apartment 6 successfully marked as booked
```

If you see warnings:
```
[WARNING] Apartment 6 is already booked (booked=true, status=RENTED)
```
This means the validation is working correctly!

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Apartment still available after payment
**Solution:** Check if `apartmentRepository.save(apt)` is being called in PaymentResultController
```bash
grep -n "apartmentRepository.save" src/main/java/com/example/project/aloy/controller/PaymentResultController.java
```

### Issue: Multiple users can book simultaneously
**Solution:** Verify pessimistic locking is enabled
```bash
grep -n "findByIdForUpdate" src/main/java/com/example/project/aloy/repository/ApartmentRepository.java
```

### Issue: Booked apartments still appear in search
**Solution:** Ensure ApartmentController uses `findAvailableApartments()`
```bash
grep -n "findAvailableApartments" src/main/java/com/example/project/aloy/controller/ApartmentController.java
```
