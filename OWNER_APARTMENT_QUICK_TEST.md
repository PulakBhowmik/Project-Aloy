## Recent Changes (Status Standardization)

We updated the status display to match our standardized values:
- **OLD**: Status could be "AVAILABLE", "BOOKED", or "RENTED"
- **NEW**: Status is only "AVAILABLE" or "BOOKED"

Changes made:
- ✅ `owner-dashboard.js` - Line 300: Changed "RENTED" to "BOOKED"
- ✅ `owner-dashboard.js` - Line 228: Changed "Rented" to "Booked" badge

Now all status displays are consistent throughout the application!

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

Consider adding:

3. **Soft delete** instead of hard delete
4. **Bulk actions** (delete multiple at once)
5. **Search/filter** apartments on dashboard
6. **Edit history** log

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Modal doesn't open
- **Fix**: Check browser console for errors, ensure Bootstrap JS is loaded

**Problem**: Changes don't save
- **Fix**: Check network tab, verify you're logged in as the apartment owner

**Problem**: Delete doesn't work
- **Fix**: Check if apartment exists, verify no foreign key constraints

**Problem**: Stats don't update
- **Fix**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5), check analytics endpoint
