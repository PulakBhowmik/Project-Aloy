### Old Payment Records Removed:
- ❌ Deleted payment record for apartment #14 (PAY14, COMPLETED)
- ❌ Deleted payment record for apartment #15 (PAY15, PENDING)

### Apartments Reset:
- ✅ Apartment #14: "Toiyob Building" - AVAILABLE, booked=0

## 🧪 You Can Now Test With Either:

### Option 1: Apartment #14 (Recommended)
```

District: Chittagong
Price: $2003/month
Status: ✅ AVAILABLE (no payment records)
```

### Option 2: Apartment #15

```

## 📋 Fresh Testing Steps:

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. **Navigate to homepage**: `http://localhost:8080/`
3. **Choose apartment #14 OR #15**
4. **Click "View Details"**
5. **Click "Book for Myself"**
6. **You should NO LONGER see the error** ✅
7. **Complete SSLCommerz test payment**
8. **Watch for:**
   - PDF download
   - "Receipt Downloaded Successfully!"
   - Automatic redirect
   - **RED "BOOKED" badge appears**

## 🔍 If You Still See Error:

The error message "This apartment is already paid for" comes from:
- `SSLCommerzPaymentController.java` line checking for existing completed payments
- This is CORRECT behavior to prevent double booking
- We've now cleared those old test records

```

**Should see:**
```
[DEBUG] Payment success GET endpoint called with tranId: PAY##
