## Frontend Components

### Files Involved:
1. **owner-dashboard.html** - Main dashboard page with:
   - Navbar with user info
   - Stats card
   - Tabs (Apartments, Tenants, Revenue, History, Top)
   - Edit modal
   - Delete confirmation modal

2. **owner-dashboard.js** - JavaScript logic with:
   - `loadOwnerApartments()` - Fetches and renders apartments

   - `openEditModal(apartmentId)` - Opens edit form with pre-filled data
   - `openDeleteModal(apartmentId)` - Opens delete confirmation

3. **ApartmentController.java** - Backend REST controller with:
   - `getApartmentsByOwnerId(@PathVariable Long ownerId)`
   - `updateApartment(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Apartment)`
   - `deleteApartment(@PathVariable Long id)`

## Security Features

### Ownership Verification:
- Frontend sends `ownerId` in the edit request body
- Backend compares request `ownerId` with existing apartment's `ownerId`
- Returns `403 Forbidden` if they don't match
- Prevents unauthorized edits

### Role-Based Access:
- Page checks if user role is "OWNER"
- Redirects to login if not logged in
- Redirects to home if not an owner

## Data Validation

### Edit Form Validation:
- **Title**: Required (HTML5 validation)
- **Monthly Rent**: Required, must be numeric (HTML5 validation)
- **Allowed For**: Required, must be solo/group/both (dropdown)
- **All other fields**: Optional

### Backend Validation:
- Checks for required fields
- Validates apartment existence
- Verifies ownership before updates
- Catches and returns errors gracefully

3. **Prevent Deletion** if apartment is currently booked
4. **Bulk Actions** (select multiple apartments, delete all)
5. **Undo Delete** feature (with time limit)
6. **Edit History** log (track changes)
7. **Confirmation on Edit** for critical fields like rent
8. **More Filters** on apartment list (by status, rent range, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Modal doesn't open
**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors. Ensure Bootstrap JS is loaded.

### Issue: Changes don't save
**Solution**: 
1. Check network tab for API response
2. Verify you're logged in as the apartment owner
3. Check for validation errors in the console

### Issue: Delete doesn't work
**Solution**: 
1. Check if apartment exists in database
2. Verify network request returns 200 OK
3. Check for foreign key constraints (tenants/payments referencing apartment)

### Issue: Stats don't update
**Solution**: 
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
2. Check `/api/owner-analytics/owner/{id}` endpoint is responding
3. Verify `loadAnalytics()` is being called
