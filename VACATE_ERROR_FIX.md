# Vacate Error Fix - "query did not return a unique result: 2" ‚úÖ

## Problem
When clicking "Vacate Apartment", users got error:
```
Error: query did not return a unique result: 2
```

## Root Cause
The database had **duplicate payment records** for the same tenant and apartment:
- Multiple payments with different statuses (PENDING, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- The old query `findByTenantIdAndApartmentId()` expected **exactly 1 result**
- Found **2 or more results** ‚Üí error thrown

### Why Duplicates Exist:
1. **Initial PENDING payment** created when user clicks "Book"
2. **Second PENDING payment** if user clicked book again
3. **COMPLETED payment** after successful payment
4. **CANCELLED payments** from failed attempts

All these records have the same `tenantId` and `apartmentId`.

---

## Solution

### Changed Query Logic:
**Before:**
```java
Optional<Payment> paymentOpt = paymentRepository.findByTenantIdAndApartmentId(tenantId, apartmentId);
```
- Returns `Optional` (expects 1 result)
- Throws error if multiple results found

**After:**
```java
List<Payment> payments = paymentRepository.findCompletedPaymentsByTenantAndApartment(tenantId, apartmentId);
Payment payment = payments.get(0); // Get most recent
```
- Returns `List` (handles multiple results)
- Filters by status = 'COMPLETED'
- Orders by paymentId DESC (most recent first)
- Takes the first (most recent) result

---

## Files Modified

### 1. PaymentRepository.java
**Added new query method:**
```java
@Query("SELECT p FROM Payment p WHERE p.tenantId = :tenantId AND p.apartmentId = :apartmentId AND p.status = 'COMPLETED' ORDER BY p.paymentId DESC")
List<Payment> findCompletedPaymentsByTenantAndApartment(@Param("tenantId") Long tenantId, @Param("apartmentId") Long apartmentId);
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Only gets COMPLETED payments (ignores PENDING/CANCELLED)
- ‚úÖ Orders by paymentId DESC (most recent first)
- ‚úÖ Returns List (no error if multiple results)
- ‚úÖ Handles edge cases gracefully

### 2. PaymentService.java
**Updated vacateApartment() method:**
```java
// OLD CODE (caused error):
Optional<Payment> paymentOpt = paymentRepository.findByTenantIdAndApartmentId(tenantId, apartmentId);
if (paymentOpt.isEmpty()) {
    throw new RuntimeException("No booking found");
}
Payment payment = paymentOpt.get();

// NEW CODE (fixed):
List<Payment> payments = paymentRepository.findCompletedPaymentsByTenantAndApartment(tenantId, apartmentId);
if (payments.isEmpty()) {
    throw new RuntimeException("No completed booking found");
}
Payment payment = payments.get(0); // Get most recent
System.out.println("[DEBUG] Found payment ID: " + payment.getPaymentId() + " with status: " + payment.getStatus());
```

---

## How It Works Now

### Vacate Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Vacate Apartment"
   ‚Üì
2. Backend searches for COMPLETED payments
   ‚Üì
3. Query: SELECT * FROM payment 
   WHERE tenant_id = ? 
   AND apartment_id = ? 
   AND status = 'COMPLETED' 
   ORDER BY payment_id DESC
   ‚Üì
4. Gets list of matching payments
   ‚Üì
5. Takes first payment (most recent)
   ‚Üì
6. Updates payment: status = 'VACATED', vacate_date = today
   ‚Üì
7. Updates apartment: booked = false, status = 'AVAILABLE'
   ‚Üì
8. Success! ‚úÖ
```

## Benefits of Fix

### ‚úÖ No More Errors
- Handles multiple payment records gracefully
- No "unique result" constraint violation

### ‚úÖ Gets Correct Payment
- Only considers COMPLETED payments
- Ignores PENDING/CANCELLED records
- Gets most recent if multiple exist

### ‚úÖ Defensive Programming
- Checks if list is empty
- Provides clear error messages
- Logs payment ID for debugging

### ‚úÖ Database Independent
- Works regardless of duplicate records
- No need to clean up old data
- Handles edge cases automatically

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Single COMPLETED Payment
```
Payments in DB:
- Payment 1: PENDING (old)
- Payment 2: COMPLETED (current) ‚Üê Selected

Result: ‚úÖ Vacate successful
```

### Test Case 2: Multiple COMPLETED Payments
```
Payments in DB:
- Payment 1: COMPLETED (old rebooking)
- Payment 2: CANCELLED (vacated)
- Payment 3: COMPLETED (current) ‚Üê Selected

Result: ‚úÖ Vacate successful (uses most recent)
```

### Test Case 3: No COMPLETED Payments
```
Payments in DB:
- Payment 1: PENDING
- Payment 2: CANCELLED

Result: ‚ùå Error: "No completed booking found"
```

## Database State

### Before Fix:
```sql
-- Multiple payments for same tenant + apartment
SELECT * FROM payment WHERE tenant_id = 2 AND apartment_id = 52;

payment_id | tenant_id | apartment_id | status    | created_at
-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|------------------
101        | 2         | 52           | PENDING   | 2025-10-09 10:00
102        | 2         | 52           | COMPLETED | 2025-10-09 10:05
```

### After Fix:
Query automatically filters and selects:
```sql
-- Query with ORDER BY
SELECT * FROM payment 
WHERE tenant_id = 2 
AND apartment_id = 52 
AND status = 'COMPLETED'
ORDER BY payment_id DESC;

-- Returns ONLY payment 102 (most recent COMPLETED)
```

---

## Optional: Database Cleanup (Not Required)

If you want to clean up old PENDING payments:
```sql
-- Delete old PENDING/CANCELLED payments (optional)
DELETE FROM payment 
WHERE status IN ('PENDING', 'CANCELLED') 
AND created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY);

-- Keep only COMPLETED and recent VACATED
```

**Note:** This is optional - the fix works with or without cleanup!
