# 🎯 Frontend Updates Applied - Testing Guide

## ✅ What Was Updated

I've updated the **frontend** to show apartment booking status on the home page!

### Changes Made:

1. **index.html (Home Page)**
   - ✅ Shows "AVAILABLE" or "BOOKED" badge on each apartment card
   - ✅ Modal displays booking status with badge
   - ✅ Hides booking buttons for booked apartments
   - ✅ Shows warning message for booked apartments

2. **apartment-details.html (Dedicated Page)**
   - ✅ Already updated (from earlier)
   - ✅ Shows booking status and hides buttons

## 🔄 How to See the Changes

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
1. Go to http://localhost:8080
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac)
   - This clears the browser cache and reloads the page
3. You should now see the booking status badges!

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Press **F12** to open DevTools
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Option 3: Use Incognito/Private Mode
1. Open a new Incognito/Private window
2. Go to http://localhost:8080
3. The changes will be visible immediately

## 📊 What You Should See Now

### Home Page (http://localhost:8080)
- Each apartment card shows:
  - ✅ **Green badge "AVAILABLE"** - for available apartments
  - ❌ **Red badge "BOOKED"** - for booked apartments (when someone books one)
  - Price per month
  - "View Details" button

### Apartment Details Modal (Click "View Details")
- Shows apartment information
- Displays booking status badge at the top
- **If Available:** Shows "Book for Myself" and "Book in a Group" buttons
- **If Booked:** Shows warning message and "Browse Other Available Apartments" button

### Apartment Details Page (/templates/apartment-details.html?id=X)
- Same features as the modal
- Full page view with all booking status

## 🧪 Test the Complete Flow

### Test 1: View Available Apartments
1. Go to http://localhost:8080 (hard refresh!)
2. You should see all apartments with **green "AVAILABLE"** badges
3. Click "View Details" on any apartment
4. Modal should show green badge and booking buttons

### Test 2: Book an Apartment
1. Click "Book for Myself"
2. Complete the payment
3. After payment, go back to home page
4. **Hard refresh the page (Ctrl + Shift + R)**
5. The booked apartment should:
   - Either disappear from the list (backend filters it)
   - OR show red "BOOKED" badge (if you view it directly)

### Test 3: Try to Book Again
1. If the apartment still shows, click "View Details"
2. You should see:
   - Red "ALREADY BOOKED" badge
   - Warning message
   - No booking buttons

## ⚠️ Important: Browser Caching

**The most common issue** is that your browser has cached the old JavaScript and HTML files.

### Signs of Caching Issues:
- ❌ No badges showing on apartments
- ❌ Booking buttons still visible for booked apartments
- ❌ Old layout without status indicators

### Solution:
**Always use Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)** after code changes!

## 🔍 Verify Backend is Working

Test the API directly:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/apartments | python -m json.tool | head -50
```

Look for:
- `"booked": false` - apartment is available
- `"status": "AVAILABLE"` - apartment is available
- `"booked": true` - apartment is booked
- `"status": "RENTED"` - apartment is booked

## 📝 Current State

✅ **Backend:** Fully functional
- Only available apartments returned from API
- Booking marks apartment as booked
- Prevents double booking

✅ **Frontend (Now Updated):**
- Shows booking status badges
- Hides buttons for booked apartments
- Displays warning messages

✅ **Database:** Reset and ready
- All 17 apartments are AVAILABLE
- Fresh start for testing

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Hard refresh** your browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. **Book an apartment** to test
3. **Verify** it disappears or shows as booked
4. **Try to book it again** - should see error/warning

## 💡 Tips

- Always hard refresh after server restarts
- Use Incognito mode for testing to avoid cache
- Check browser console (F12) for any JavaScript errors
- Check network tab (F12) to see API responses
