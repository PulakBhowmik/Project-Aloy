# Quick Testing Guide - Badge Display Fix

## Problem Fixed
✅ **Frontend was showing "AVAILABLE" tags for booked apartments**  
✅ **Root cause: JavaScript function didn't check booking status**  
✅ **Solution: Updated displayApartments() to show RED/GREEN badges based on database status**

---

## IMMEDIATE TEST (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
**Chrome/Edge:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Click "Clear data"

**OR use Incognito mode:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + N`

### Step 2: Load Homepage
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

### Step 3: Look for Badges
You should see:
- 🔴 **RED "BOOKED"** badges on apartments #6 and #11 (these are rented in database)
- 🟢 **GREEN "AVAILABLE"** badges on all other apartments

---

## Expected Visual Result

### Apartment Card Layout:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│     [Apartment Image]       │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ $2000/month    [🔴 BOOKED]  │  ← Badge should be RED
│                             │
│ Apartment Title             │
│ Description text...         │
│                             │
│ Location: District          │
│ Available from: Date        │
│ [View Details]              │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### For Available Apartments:
```
│ $1500/month  [🟢 AVAILABLE] │  ← Badge should be GREEN
```

## Database Verification (if badges still wrong)

If you DON'T see the correct badges, run:

```bash
mysql -u rental_user2 -p123456 -D apartment_rental_db -e "SELECT apartment_id, address, booked, status FROM apartments WHERE apartment_id IN (6,11,14,15);"
```

Expected result:
```
apartment_id=6,  booked=0x01, status='RENTED'     ← Should show RED BOOKED
apartment_id=11, booked=0x01, status='RENTED'     ← Should show RED BOOKED
apartment_id=14, booked=0x00, status='AVAILABLE'  ← Should show GREEN AVAILABLE
apartment_id=15, booked=0x00, status='AVAILABLE'  ← Should show GREEN AVAILABLE
```

---

## API Verification

Test the backend is returning correct data:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/apartments/6 | grep -o '"booked":[^,]*'
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/apartments/11 | grep -o '"booked":[^,]*'
```

Expected:
```
"booked":true   ← Apartment 6
"booked":true   ← Apartment 11
```

---

## What Changed

### Before Fix:
❌ `app.js` had no badge logic  
❌ Only price tag displayed  
❌ No indication of booking status  
❌ Looked like all apartments were available

### After Fix:
✅ `app.js` checks `apartment.booked` and `apartment.status`  
✅ Shows RED badge for booked apartments  
✅ Shows GREEN badge for available apartments  
✅ Cache-busting ensures fresh data from backend

---

## If Badges Still Not Showing

### 1. Hard Refresh
- Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### 2. Check JavaScript Console
- Press `F12` to open DevTools
- Go to Console tab
- Look for errors (should be none)
- Verify fetch requests show `nocache=` parameter

### 3. Check Network Tab
- Press `F12` → Network tab
- Reload page
- Find request to `/api/apartments?nocache=...`
- Click on it → Preview tab
- Verify apartment #6 shows: `"booked": true, "status": "RENTED"`

### 4. Verify JavaScript loaded
- Press `F12` → Network tab
- Find `/js/app.js` request
- Click → Response tab
- Search for text: `const isBooked`
- Should find this code:
  ```javascript
  const isBooked = apartment.booked || apartment.status === 'RENTED';
  const statusBadge = isBooked ? '<span class="badge bg-danger">BOOKED</span>' : '<span class="badge bg-success">AVAILABLE</span>';
  ```

## Application Status

✅ **Backend:** Running on port 8080  
✅ **Database:** Apartments #6 and #11 marked as RENTED  
✅ **API:** Returning correct booking status  
✅ **Frontend:** Updated with badge display logic  
✅ **Cache-Busting:** Implemented to prevent stale data  

**Everything is ready for testing!**

## Quick Confirmation Commands

Run all these in one go:
```bash
# 1. Check application is running
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/apartments/6 > /dev/null && echo "✅ Application is running" || echo "❌ Application is down"

# 2. Check apartment 6 status
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/apartments/6 | grep -o '"booked":true' && echo "✅ Apartment 6 is booked" || echo "❌ Problem with apartment 6"

# 3. Check apartment 11 status
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/apartments/11 | grep -o '"booked":true' && echo "✅ Apartment 11 is booked" || echo "❌ Problem with apartment 11"

# 4. Verify updated JavaScript is being served
curl -s http://localhost:8080/js/app.js | grep "const isBooked" && echo "✅ JavaScript updated correctly" || echo "❌ JavaScript not updated"
```
