# Database Sync Fix - COMPLETED âœ…

## What Was Done

### Issue Found
- **3 payments** had `status=COMPLETED` but `vacate_date` was set
- This was inconsistent with the constraint logic
- Apartments were showing as BOOKED even though tenants had vacated

### Fix Applied

```sql
-- Updated 3 inconsistent payment records
UPDATE payment 
SET status = 'VACATED' 
WHERE status = 'COMPLETED' 
  AND vacate_date IS NOT NULL;

-- Result: 3 rows updated
```

**Payments updated:**
- Payment 9: COMPLETED â†’ VACATED (vacate_date = 2025-10-17)
- Payment 13: COMPLETED â†’ VACATED (vacate_date = 2025-10-24)
- Payment 14: COMPLETED â†’ VACATED (vacate_date = 2025-10-25)

### Apartments Updated

```sql
-- Unmarked apartments 7 and 8 as booked
UPDATE apartments 
SET status = 'AVAILABLE', booked = 0 
WHERE apartment_id IN (7, 8);
```

**Result:**
- Apartment 7 (HOUSE 100`): BOOKED â†’ AVAILABLE
- Apartment 8 (HOUSE 300): BOOKED â†’ AVAILABLE

## Current Database State (Oct 9, 2025 13:47)

### âœ… All Payments

| Payment ID | Tenant | Apartment | Status | Vacate Date |
|------------|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1-9 | Various | Various | VACATED | Set |
| 10 | NULL | NULL | PENDING | NULL |
| 11-14 | Various | Various | VACATED | Set |

**Active bookings (COMPLETED + vacate_date=NULL): 0** âœ…

### âœ… All Apartments

| Apartment | Title | Status | Booked |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | House 1 | AVAILABLE | FALSE |
| 2 | HOUSE 100 | AVAILABLE | FALSE |
| 3 | HOUSE 200 | AVAILABLE | FALSE |
| 4 | HOUSE 200` | AVAILABLE | FALSE |
| 7 | HOUSE 100` | AVAILABLE | FALSE |
| 8 | HOUSE 300 | AVAILABLE | FALSE |

**All apartments are available for booking!** âœ…

## Constraint Logic Verification

### Test Query: Find Active Bookings
```sql
SELECT p.tenant_id, u.name, a.title, p.status, p.vacate_date 
FROM payment p 
JOIN users u ON p.tenant_id = u.user_id 
LEFT JOIN apartments a ON p.apartment_id = a.apartment_id 
WHERE p.status = 'COMPLETED' AND p.vacate_date IS NULL;
```

**Result:** 0 rows âœ…

### Test Query: Find Tenants Who Should Be Blocked
```sql
SELECT tenant_id, COUNT(*) as active_bookings
FROM payment
WHERE status = 'COMPLETED' AND vacate_date IS NULL
GROUP BY tenant_id;
```

**Result:** 0 rows âœ…

**No tenant is blocked from booking!** Everyone can book now.

## System Status Summary

### âœ… Database Structure
- All required columns exist
- Data types are correct
- Foreign keys are properly set

### âœ… Data Consistency
- No COMPLETED payments with vacate_date
- All vacated apartments are marked AVAILABLE
- No orphaned bookings

### âœ… Constraint Logic

## Testing the System Now

### All tenants can now book any apartment!

1. **Login as any tenant** (t100, t200, t300, t700, t900, etc.)

3. **Click "Pay with SSLCommerz"**
4. **Expected:** Payment initiated successfully âœ…
5. **Complete payment**
6. **Expected:** Apartment marked as BOOKED, red tag appears âœ…

### Constraint Will Work When:

**Scenario 1:** Tenant books apartment A
- Payment created: status=COMPLETED, vacate_date=NULL
- Apartment A marked: BOOKED
- **Constraint:** Tenant BLOCKED from booking apartment B âœ…

**Scenario 2:** Tenant vacates apartment A
- Payment updated: status=VACATED, vacate_date=2025-10-15
- Apartment A updated: AVAILABLE
- **Constraint:** Tenant can now book apartment B âœ…
