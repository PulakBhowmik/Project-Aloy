# Database Cleanup - Unique Apartment Titles

## ‚úÖ Changes Applied (October 5, 2025 @ 10:20 PM)

### Problem:
- Multiple apartments had duplicate titles (e.g., "Luxury Downtown Apartment")
- Apartments 15-17 had NULL titles
- Made it difficult for users to distinguish between apartments

### Solution:
Updated all apartments with unique, descriptive titles
