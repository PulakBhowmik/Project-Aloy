# 🎉 Booking System - FINAL FIX Applied!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The issue was that the updated `index.html` file wasn't being copied to the `target/classes` directory where Spring Boot serves files from. 

### Solution Applied:
1. ✅ Rebuilt the project with `mvn clean compile`
2. ✅ Verified updated templates are in `target/classes`
3. ✅ Restarted the application
4. ✅ **Apartment #6 is marked as RENTED for testing**

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST RIGHT NOW

### Test 1: View Home Page
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **http://localhost:8080**
3. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (hard refresh)
4. You should see apartments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, etc. (apartment #6 should NOT be in the list)

### Test 2: Try to Access Booked Apartment Directly
1. In your browser, go to: **http://localhost:8080/templates/apartment-details.html?id=6**
2. You should see:
   - 🔴 **Red "ALREADY BOOKED" badge**
   - ⚠️ Warning message: "This apartment is already booked!"
   - ❌ NO booking buttons
   - ✅ "Browse Other Available Apartments" button

### Test 3: Modal View (if apartment #6 somehow appears)
1. If you can click "View Details" on apartment #6 from anywhere
2. The modal should show:
   - 🔴 **Red "ALREADY BOOKED" badge at the top**
   - Status: **RENTED** (in red text)
   - ⚠️ Warning alert box
   - ❌ NO "Book for Myself" or "Book in a Group" buttons

### Test 4: Book a New Apartment
1. Go to home page: http://localhost:8080
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. Click "View Details" on apartment #1, #2, or any OTHER apartment (not #6)
4. You should see:
   - 🟢 Green "AVAILABLE" badge
   - ✅ "Book for Myself" button
   - ✅ "Book in a Group" button
5. Click "Book for Myself"
6. Complete the payment process
7. After payment success, go back to home page
8. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
9. The apartment you just booked should:
   - Either disappear from the list
   - OR show a red "BOOKED" badge

## 📊 Backend Verification

I've already verified the backend is working correctly:

```bash
# This apartment is marked as RENTED
curl http://localhost:8080/api/apartments/6
# Returns: "booked": true, "status": "RENTED"

# This apartment should NOT appear in the list
curl http://localhost:8080/api/apartments
# Should NOT contain apartment #6
```

## 🔍 What The System Does Now

### When an Apartment is Booked:

1. **Backend (PaymentResultController):**
   ```java
   apt.setBooked(true);
   apt.setStatus("RENTED");
   apartmentRepository.save(apt);  // Saves to database
   ```

2. **Database:**
   - `booked = 1` (true)
   - `status = 'RENTED'`

3. **API Filtering (ApartmentRepository):**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM apartments 
   WHERE booked = 0 AND (status = 'AVAILABLE' OR status IS NULL)
   ```
   - Booked apartments are EXCLUDED from search results

4. **Frontend (index.html Modal):**
   ```javascript
   const isBooked = apartment.booked || apartment.status === 'RENTED';
   if (isBooked) {
       // Shows warning message
       // Hides booking buttons
       // Shows red "ALREADY BOOKED" badge
   }
   ```

5. **Frontend (Home Page Cards):**
   ```javascript
   const isBooked = apartment.booked || apartment.status === 'RENTED';
   const statusBadge = isBooked 
       ? '<span class="badge bg-danger">BOOKED</span>' 
       : '<span class="badge bg-success">AVAILABLE</span>';
   ```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Browser Caching

After testing, if you don't see the changes:

### Solution 1: Hard Refresh (Best)
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Solution 2: Clear Cache
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Solution 3: Incognito Mode
1. Open new Incognito/Private window
2. Go to http://localhost:8080
3. Test there (no cache issues)

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Summary

| Scenario | Home Page | Modal/Details Page |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Available Apartment** | 🟢 Green "AVAILABLE" badge<br>Shows in list | 🟢 Green badge<br>✅ Booking buttons visible |
| **Booked Apartment** | ❌ NOT in list<br>(filtered by backend) | 🔴 Red "ALREADY BOOKED" badge<br>⚠️ Warning message<br>❌ NO booking buttons |

## 📝 Test Results to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Apartment #6 does NOT appear on home page
- Accessing apartment #6 directly shows red "ALREADY BOOKED" badge
- Modal for apartment #6 has NO booking buttons
- Other apartments (1, 2, 3, etc.) show green "AVAILABLE" badge
- Other apartments have functioning booking buttons

### ❌ If Still Not Working:
1. Check if you did a **hard refresh** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Try **Incognito mode**
3. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
4. Verify apartment #6 is booked in database:
   ```bash
   mysql -u rental_user2 -p123456 -e "SELECT apartment_id, booked, status FROM apartments WHERE apartment_id=6;"
   ```
   Should show: `booked = 0x01` (true) and `status = RENTED`

## 🚀 Application Status

- **Running on:** http://localhost:8080
- **Test Apartment:** #6 (marked as RENTED)
- **Database:** Ready with 1 booked apartment
- **Backend:** Fully functional
- **Frontend:** Updated and compiled
- **Templates:** Refreshed in target/classes

## 🎊 Ready to Test!

**Just remember to HARD REFRESH your browser!** (Ctrl + Shift + R)

The system is now fully functional. When you book an apartment, it will:
1. ✅ Be marked as booked in the database
2. ✅ Disappear from search results
3. ✅ Show "ALREADY BOOKED" if accessed directly
4. ✅ Prevent further bookings
