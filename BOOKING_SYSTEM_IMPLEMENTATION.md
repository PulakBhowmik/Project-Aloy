# Apartment Booking System - Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the apartment availability and booking control system to ensure that once an apartment is booked, it cannot be booked again by another person.

## Problem Statement
**Original Issue:** When a payment was made for an apartment, the apartment remained available for others to book. Multiple users could book the same apartment simultaneously.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
The database already had the necessary fields:
- `booked` (TINYINT): Boolean flag indicating if an apartment is booked
- `status` (VARCHAR): Status field that can be 'AVAILABLE' or 'RENTED'

**Migration Applied:**
```sql
-- Updated all NULL status apartments to AVAILABLE
UPDATE apartments SET status = 'AVAILABLE' WHERE status IS NULL OR status = '';
```

### 2. Backend Changes

#### A. ApartmentRepository.java
**File:** `src/main/java/com/example/project/aloy/repository/ApartmentRepository.java`

**New Method Added:**
```java
// Find all available apartments (not booked AND status is AVAILABLE)
@Query("SELECT a FROM Apartment a WHERE a.booked = false AND (a.status = 'AVAILABLE' OR a.status IS NULL)")
java.util.List<Apartment> findAvailableApartments();
```

**Purpose:** This query ensures that only apartments that are:
1. NOT booked (booked = false)
2. AND have status = 'AVAILABLE' or NULL

are returned in search results.

#### B. ApartmentController.java
**File:** `src/main/java/com/example/project/aloy/controller/ApartmentController.java`

**Changes:**
1. **getAllApartments()** - Updated to use `findAvailableApartments()`
   - Previously: `apartmentRepository.findByBookedFalse()`
   - Now: `apartmentRepository.findAvailableApartments()`

2. **searchApartments()** - Updated to use `findAvailableApartments()`
   - Ensures search results only show available apartments

#### C. PaymentResultController.java
**File:** `src/main/java/com/example/project/aloy/controller/PaymentResultController.java`

**Enhanced Payment Success Handler:**
```java
if (!apt.isBooked()) {
    System.out.println("[DEBUG] Marking apartment " + aptId + " as booked and RENTED");
    apt.setBooked(true);
    apt.setStatus("RENTED");
    apartmentRepository.save(apt);  // CRITICAL: Save the apartment!
    System.out.println("[DEBUG] Apartment " + aptId + " successfully marked as booked");
} else {
    System.out.println("[WARNING] Apartment " + aptId + " is already booked!");
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Sets `booked = true`
- Sets `status = 'RENTED'`
- **Saves the apartment to database** (this was missing before!)
- Adds debug logging for tracking

#### D. SSLCommerzPaymentController.java
**File:** `src/main/java/com/example/project/aloy/controller/SSLCommerzPaymentController.java`

**Enhanced Booking Validation:**
```java
// Check if apartment is already booked or status is RENTED
if (ap.isBooked() || "RENTED".equalsIgnoreCase(ap.getStatus())) {
    System.out.println("[WARNING] Apartment " + apartmentId + " is already booked");
    return ResponseEntity.status(409).body(Collections.singletonMap(
        "error", 
        "This apartment is already booked. Please choose another one."
    ));
}

// Check for existing completed payments
if (existing != null && "COMPLETED".equalsIgnoreCase(existing.getStatus())) {
    System.out.println("[WARNING] Apartment " + apartmentId + " already has a completed payment");
    return ResponseEntity.status(409).body(Collections.singletonMap(
        "error", 
        "This apartment is already paid for. Please choose another one."
    ));
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Checks both `booked` flag AND `status` field
- Returns HTTP 409 (Conflict) with user-friendly error message
- Uses pessimistic locking (`findByIdForUpdate`) to prevent race conditions
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 3. Frontend Changes

#### A. apartment-details.html
**File:** `src/main/resources/templates/apartment-details.html`

**Enhanced UI with Booking Status:**
```javascript
// Check if apartment is booked
const isBooked = apartment.booked || apartment.status === 'RENTED';
const bookingStatusBadge = isBooked 
    ? '<span class="badge bg-danger fs-6">ALREADY BOOKED</span>' 
    : '<span class="badge bg-success fs-6">AVAILABLE</span>';
```

**Conditional Rendering:**
- If apartment is booked: Shows warning message and "Browse Other Apartments" button
- If apartment is available: Shows "Book for Myself" and "Book in a Group" buttons

**Warning Message for Booked Apartments:**
```html
<div class="alert alert-warning mt-4" role="alert">
    <h5 class="alert-heading">⚠️ This apartment is already booked!</h5>
    <p>Unfortunately, this property has already been rented to another tenant.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="mb-0">
        <a href="/" class="btn btn-primary">Browse Other Available Apartments</a>
    </p>
</div>
```

#### B. app.js
**File:** `src/main/resources/static/js/app.js`

**Enhanced Error Handling:**
```javascript
.then(function(res) { 
    if (!res.ok) {
        // Handle HTTP error codes (409 for conflict, etc.)
        return res.json().then(function(errorData) {
            throw new Error(errorData.error || 'Payment failed');
        });
    }
    return res.json(); 
})
.catch(function(error) {
    console.error('Payment error:', error);
    var errorMessage = error.message || 'Payment failed';
    document.getElementById('paymentMsg').innerHTML = 
        '<span class="text-danger"><strong>Error:</strong> ' + errorMessage + '</span>';
});
```

**Key Changes:**
- Properly handles HTTP 409 (Conflict) responses
- Displays backend error messages to users
- Better error logging for debugging

## How It Works - Complete Flow

### Scenario 1: First User Books an Apartment

1. **User views apartment details**
   - Frontend fetches apartment data via `/api/apartments/{id}`
   - Shows "AVAILABLE" badge and booking buttons

2. **User clicks "Book for Myself"**
   - JavaScript sends payment initiation request to `/api/payments/initiate`
   - Includes `apartmentId` and `tenantId`

3. **Backend validates availability**
   - Uses pessimistic lock: `findByIdForUpdate(apartmentId)`
   - Checks: `if (ap.isBooked() || "RENTED".equals(ap.getStatus()))`
   - If available: Creates PENDING payment record
   - Returns SSLCommerz gateway URL

4. **User completes payment**
   - SSLCommerz redirects to `/payment-success/download?tran_id=XXX`
   - Backend callback handler at `POST /payment-success` is triggered

5. **Backend marks apartment as booked**
   ```java
   apt.setBooked(true);
   apt.setStatus("RENTED");
   apartmentRepository.save(apt);
   ```

6. **Payment receipt generated**
   - PDF includes transaction details, apartment info, owner and tenant details
   - User redirected to home page

### Scenario 2: Second User Tries to Book Same Apartment

1. **User views apartment details**
   - Frontend fetches apartment data
   - Detects `apartment.booked === true` OR `apartment.status === 'RENTED'`
   - Shows "ALREADY BOOKED" badge
   - Displays warning message
   - Booking buttons are NOT rendered

2. **If user somehow bypasses frontend (direct API call)**
   - Backend validation at `/api/payments/initiate` catches it
   - Returns HTTP 409: `"This apartment is already booked. Please choose another one."`
   - Payment is NOT initiated

3. **Home page and search results**
   - Only show available apartments via `findAvailableApartments()`
   - Booked apartments are automatically excluded from listings

## Security Features

### 1. Pessimistic Locking
```java
@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)
@Query("select a from Apartment a where a.apartmentId = :id")
Optional<Apartment> findByIdForUpdate(@Param("id") Long id);
```
- Prevents race conditions when multiple users try to book simultaneously
- Database-level row lock ensures only one transaction can modify the apartment at a time

### 2. Transactional Consistency
```java
@Transactional
public ResponseEntity<?> initiatePayment(@RequestBody Map<String, Object> paymentRequest)
```
- All payment operations are wrapped in transactions
- If any step fails, the entire operation is rolled back

### 3. Multi-Layer Validation
1. **Frontend:** UI prevents booking of unavailable apartments
2. **Backend Payment Initiation:** Validates availability before creating payment
3. **Backend Payment Completion:** Double-checks availability before marking as booked
4. **Database Constraints:** Foreign keys and unique constraints prevent data corruption

## Testing the Feature

### Test Case 1: Single Booking
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080
2. Select an available apartment
3. Click "Book for Myself"
4. Complete payment
5. Verify apartment shows as "ALREADY BOOKED" after refresh
6. Verify apartment no longer appears in home page search results

### Test Case 2: Concurrent Booking Attempt
1. Open two browser windows
2. Navigate to same apartment in both
3. Try to book simultaneously
4. First user: Payment should succeed
5. Second user: Should see error "This apartment is already booked"

### Test Case 3: Database Verification
```sql
-- Check apartment status after booking
SELECT apartment_id, title, booked, status 
FROM apartments 
WHERE apartment_id = [BOOKED_APARTMENT_ID];

-- Should show: booked = 1, status = 'RENTED'

-- Check payment record
SELECT payment_id, apartment_id, transaction_id, status 
FROM payment 
WHERE apartment_id = [BOOKED_APARTMENT_ID];

-- Should show: status = 'COMPLETED'
```

## Debugging

### Enable Debug Logs
All critical operations have debug logging:
```
[DEBUG] Parsed apartmentId: 6
[DEBUG] Marking apartment 6 as booked and RENTED
[DEBUG] Apartment 6 successfully marked as booked
[WARNING] Apartment 6 is already booked (booked=true, status=RENTED)
```

### Check Application Logs
Monitor console output for booking operations:
```bash
tail -f logs/spring.log
```

### Verify Database State
```sql
-- See all available apartments
SELECT apartment_id, title, booked, status 
FROM apartments 
WHERE booked = 0 AND (status = 'AVAILABLE' OR status IS NULL);

-- See all booked apartments
SELECT apartment_id, title, booked, status 
FROM apartments 
WHERE booked = 1 OR status = 'RENTED';
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Null Status Fields:** Query handles `status IS NULL` for backward compatibility
2. **Duplicate Transaction IDs:** Transaction ID cleaning prevents duplicates
3. **Race Conditions:** Pessimistic locking prevents simultaneous bookings
4. **Failed Payments:** Apartments remain available if payment fails (status stays PENDING)
5. **Frontend Bypass:** Backend validation prevents API manipulation

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Additions:

1. **Apartment Unbooking (Admin Feature)**
   ```java
   @PostMapping("/api/apartments/{id}/unbook")
   public ResponseEntity<?> unbookApartment(@PathVariable Long id) {
       // For admin use when tenant moves out
   }
   ```

2. **Booking History**
   - Track all booking attempts (successful and failed)
   - Link payments to specific booking timestamps

3. **Booking Expiration**
   - Automatically release apartments if payment is PENDING for > 24 hours
   - Implement scheduled job to clean up stale bookings

4. **Waitlist Feature**
   - Allow users to join waitlist for booked apartments
   - Notify when apartment becomes available again

5. **Booking Notifications**
   - Email confirmation to tenant and owner
   - SMS notification when apartment is booked
